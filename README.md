# Project Mayhem

## About
Project Mayhem is a tool to kill VMs in a [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org) [bosh](https://bosh.io) deployed system.
The purpose is to test high availability and resiliency of a system.
It's also your homework assignment from [Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/).

## Features / TODOs
Initially targetting the ability to:
- [ ] point to a bosh deployment
- [ ] list vms in deployment
- [ ] schedule or trigger a manual attack to randomly kill vms within the deployment
- [ ] whitelist vms to exclude from the attack
- [ ] IAAS : initially targetting Softlayer
- [ ] API to get the system status (including status, deployment, virtual machines)
- [ ] API to start an attack
- [ ] API to stop an attack
